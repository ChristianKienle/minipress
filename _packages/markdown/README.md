# `@minipress/markdown`

This package contains everything *miniPress* needs to support Markdown.

At it's core this package depends on [saber-markdown](https://github.com/saberland/saber) which is developed by [@egoist](https://github.com/egoist) (and others). Most of the plugins have been either directly copied (and sometimes slightly modified) from [saber](https://github.com/saberland/saber).

[@egoist](https://github.com/egoist) â€“ I am so grateful for all of the hard work you do.
