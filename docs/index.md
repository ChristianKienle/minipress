# Welcome to *MinPress*

*MinPress* is a _minimalistic_ Vue-powered static site generator.

The main motivation for the development of *MinPress* was to get a better understanding of Vue + SSR + Webpack and all other related technologies. VuePress and Nuxt sometimes look like like magic: Things just work and you don't know why or how. This is not a bad thing â€“ to the contrary. This makes those tools amazing and jaw dropping. They work really and come with a lot of features and a whole ecosystem. They even have a well tought out plugin API. Thus they should be used for any serious project.

However, if you just want to know how a tool like VuePress works it might be a good idea to take a closer look at *MinPress*.

*MinPress* is a very simple and minimalistic implementation of a subset of VuePress.

> If you don't intend to look at the code of *MinPress* it might be a good idea to not look at *MinPress* at all.
