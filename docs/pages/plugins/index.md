## Writing a Plugin

A plugin is a normal NPM package. Its entry point (`main`-file) should export an `object` with an `apply`-function. The `apply`-function will be called by *miniPress* early on:


```js
module.exports = {
  apply(minipress, options) {
    // plugin implementation goes here
  }
}
```

`apply` has access to two things:

1. `minipress`: The *miniPress*-instance.
2. `options`: The plugin options passed to the plugin by the consumer. This can be `undefined` in case no options have been specified. There is no fallback to `{}`.

It is the duty of the plugin developer to do the right thing inside `apply`. You may use any public method on the `minipress`-instance in case you have special needs. The `minipress`-instance opens the door to a very poweful meachnism: **hooks**.

### Hooks
You can use hooks to hook into almost every aspect of *miniPress*. Hooks are called by *miniPress* â€“ you only have to register for all the hooks you want and wait to be called. Just like at the doctors office. Sit still. Don't say a word.

#### `chainWebpack`
#### `getWebpackConfig`
#### `getHead`
#### `configureSiteData`
#### `emitPages`
#### `emitRoutes`

### `minipress`-Instance
