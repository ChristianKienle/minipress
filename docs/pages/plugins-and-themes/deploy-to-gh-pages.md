## Options
`@minipress/plugin-deploy-to-gh-pages` can be configured in case the defaults don't work for you.

- `skipGenerate` â€“ default: `false`: By default `@minipress/plugin-deploy-to-gh-pages` will generate a static build of your site and then deploy it. If you want to skip the generation process set `skipGenerate` to `true`.
- `ghpagesOptions`: Under the hood `@minipress/plugin-deploy-to-gh-pages` uses the [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages)-package to do the heavy lifting. [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) can be configured by setting certain options. Whatever you specify in `ghpagesOptions` will be passed as is to [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages).
