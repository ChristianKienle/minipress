The Snappy Apps Platform allows you to build stunning, scaleable and Fiori-compliant Apps. It comes with a command line interface that gets you started in less than five minutes. You can extend the Snappy Apps Platform by writing custom plugins. Under the hood we use tools like Webpack, Fundamental Styles, Fundamental Vue and miniPress to either generate a static version of your app or a SSR-ready executable.
